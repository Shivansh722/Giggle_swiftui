# Giggle

**Giggle** is a platform designed for pre-professionals and students seeking part-time job opportunities across various sectors. It empowers students to gain financial independence while enhancing their career experience by exploring roles within or outside their field of study. A concept that traditionally exists around the globe but majorily gets overlooked due to its unorganised market holding. Whether it's a Computer Science student at the University of Edinburgh working as a barista or at a Domino‚Äôs to support living costs, Giggle enables users to build real-world skills and financial awareness before entering the full-time workforce.

## üöÄ Vision

Our mission is to bridge the gap between youth unemployment and the retail and service industries, particularly in markets like North America, Europe, the UK, and Australia. These regions have an unstructured gig sector, which leaves room for innovation in connecting students and pre-professionals with part-time work opportunities. The platform also holds potential for the Indian market, where youth employment in retail is hindered by traditional barriers and low wage structures. By addressing these issues, we aim to create an ecosystem beneficial to both students and retail employers.

## üìà Why Giggle?

**Giggle** addresses two fundamental issues:
1. **Youth Unemployment**: By connecting students with jobs that fit their needs and schedules, Giggle offers a sustainable approach to gaining practical work experience.
2. **Retail Workforce Needs**: Large retail corporations often struggle with staffing in India due to cultural and financial challenges. Giggle creates a bridge for these businesses to access a motivated youth workforce.

## üåê Future Plans

After successful initial market penetration in Europe, North America, Australia, and the UK, Giggle plans to explore India's market by addressing traditional workforce barriers. Post-liberalization retail corporations in India still face challenges in attracting local youth due to social stigma and low wage issues. Giggle aspires to break down these barriers, offering an India-specific solution that complements both youth aspirations and retail staffing needs.
